COVID-19 Country-Specific Data Analysis
Project Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze a COVID-19 country-specific dataset to understand patterns and insights using Python. This project focuses on basic data analysis techniques for educational and practice purposes.


Dataset Information:

1.Source: Collected from Kaggle
2.Content: Data for 187 countries and 15 columns
3.Condition: Cleaned, complete dataset with no missing values


Tools & Libraries Used:

1.Pandas: For dataset loading and exploration
2.NumPy: For numerical operations
3.Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization


Features:

Acknowledgement
This project was completed as part of my self-learning journey. I used AI guidance along with Python documentation and online resources to complete the project and understand the analysis workflow.


Conclusion
This COVID-19 dataset analysis provides a quick overview of how the pandemic affected countries differently, based on infection and death counts.
The analysis highlights significant variations in confirmed cases and death rates across the globe. It successfully identifies global health hotspots and provides a clear overview of the pandemic's impact using data science tools.
The project is designed for learning and academic purposes using beginner-friendly Python data analysis tools.
